# Upskilling Resources for the Design Team 

## Areas to upskill in

### GitHub
GitHub is the repository for all aspects of the project, being able to push and pull requests, merge changes and navigate GitHub is an essential skill for being part of this project.

The following two courses should be completed by team members before being granted access to the [Chameleon-company GitHub repositories](https://github.com/Chameleon-company).

### Trello
**Trello:** Trello is the platform we use to plan all of our tasks and visualise our deliverables. We can also use this to assign team members tasks to do and easily see which tasks are being worked on during sprint 0, 1, and 2.

### Front end 
**JavaScript, HTML, CSS:** The website content, styling, and functionality such as navbar, search input, and clickable buttons are all coded using these ubiquitous tools. 

### Back end
**Python, Flask:** In the backend, the webapp runs on Flask, a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide these functions. 

### Cyber Security
**Cyber Security:** Cyber Security is an important area to consider when building and designing a webapp. Currently the webapp has Talisman which is a flask security extension.
