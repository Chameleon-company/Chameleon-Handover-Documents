# Upskilling Resources for the Web Development Team 


## Areas to upskill in

### GitHub
GitHub is the repository for all aspects of the project, being able to push and pull requests, merge changes and navigate GitHub is an essential skill for being part of this project.

### Front end 
**JavaScript, HTML, CSS:** The website content, styling, and functionality such as navbar, search input, and clickable buttons are all coded using these ubiquitous tools. 

### Back end
**Python, Flask:** In the backend, the webapp runs on Flask, a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide these functions. 

### Security 
**Flask-Talisman:** Talisman is a small Flask extension that handles setting HTTP headers that can help protect against a few common web application security issues. 

### Deployments
**Docker, Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Docker is the most popular solution for creating and working with containers. The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is the current platform used to host and deploy the webapp. There are many other services available in these Cloud Providers that we can use as we expand the project. 

### Integrated Development Environment
**Visual Studio Code:** Visual Studio Code is a lightweight code editor which the Web Development Team uses for coding in the webapp. It allows for running the Flask server in a local development environment so we can see changes live in a browser, and it also has several useful extensions for working with GitHub, debugging, etc.
