# Upskilling Resources for the Data Science and Engineering Team 



## Areas to upskill in

### GitHub
GitHub is the repository for all aspects of the project, being able to push and pull requests, merge changes and navigate GitHub is an essential skill for being part of this project.

The following two courses should be completed by team members before being granted access to the [Chameleon Company GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/Chameleon-company).

### Trello
**Trello:** Trello is the platform we use to plan all of our tasks and visualise our deliverables. We can also use this to assign team members tasks to do and easily see which tasks are being worked on during sprint 0, 1, and 2.

### General Python
**SodaPy, Pandas, NumPy:** The DS Team works with the powerful, open-source Python language and its well-known utility libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. SodaPy is also used to access Melbourne Open Data through the Socrata API. 

### NLP Libraries
**PyLDAvis, NLTK, Spacy, Genism:** Some Natural Language processing libraries may be used for future work in the backlog. 

### Geospatial Libraries 
**GeoPy, Shapely, GeoPandas:** These libraries are used for the various mapping tools and visualisations used in our use-cases. 

### Integrated Development Environment 
**Jupyter Notebooks:** Jupyter Notebooks are the tool of choice for data scientists working with Python, allowing us to create and share documents that integrate live code, equations, computational output, visualizations, and other multimedia, along with explanatory text in a single document. Notebooks are created by the Data Science Team for each use-case, which can be converted to HTML by the Web Development Team to display on the site.
