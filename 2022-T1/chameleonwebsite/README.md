## Project Overview

Like any other company, the Chameleon company requires a website to be its digital public facing space. The main goal of the website is to promote Chameleon’s projects, products, and the services that it provides. As the project implementation progresses additional features and functionalities will be added such as blogs, events calendar, and a clients’ area.

The Chameleon website doesn't have at the moment a dedicated domain name. It is assigned a random URL whenever the pipeline runs after each checkin. At the end of T1 2022, the website is reachable on <WEBSITE_URL>

## Software Requirement Specification (SRS)

The Web Dev team has built a [Software Requirement Specification](handover/SRS-Chameleon-WebsiteV1.0.docx)  document based on the initial requirements that were collected from:

* Initial set of requirements from the company board
* Ideation workshop of all the project students

The Web Design team has provided the necessary web font, colours and layouts that the web dev team used in the SRS and then built into the website.
