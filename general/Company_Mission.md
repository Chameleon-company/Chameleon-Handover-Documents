# Chameleon Company Mission

"Given the complexity of energy application needs today, IoT systems are being designed to address a wide variety of existing problems. 

In Chameleon, our mission is to research, create, test, document and deploy IoT-based solutions to enhance life through the application of smart city technologies including: the building of smarter cities, homes, transportation, and energy management systems." 

There are 3 divisions within the company, focusing on the 3 key areas of strategic importance: 

- City of Melbourne Open Data 
- Chameleon Website 
- Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Tools 

Both the open data project and the EV adoption tools leverage data sets that are created using IoT-based sensors and as such, fit into the goals of the company. The Chameleon website articulates the goals of the company and provides a visible presence. 

The goals of the City of Melbourne Open Playground are to create a toolset to assist non-technical users in understanding some of the challenges that open data in the City of Melbourne can help to solve, along with useful, step by step examples. 

The EV adoption tools division will be focusing on 3 projects. These projects will all related to building out tools to help drive EV adoption and/ or solve challenges associated with building out EV infrastructure.
